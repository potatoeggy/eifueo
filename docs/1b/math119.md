## Multivariable functions

!!! definition
    - A **multivariable function** accepts more than one independent variable, e.g., $f(x, y)$.

The signature of multivariable functions is indicated in the form *[identifier]*: *[input type]* â†’ *[return type]*. Where $n$ is the number of inputs:

$$f: \mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R$$

!!! example
    The following function is in the form $f: \mathbb R^2\to\mathbb R$ and maps two variables into one called $z$ via function $f$.
    
    $$(x,y)\longmapsto z=f(x,y)$$

### Sketching multivariable functions

!!! definition
    - In a **scalar field**, each point in space is assigned a number. For example, topography or altitude maps are scalar fields.
    - A **level curve** is a slice of a three-dimensional graph by setting to a general variable $f(x, y)=k$. It is effectively a series of contour plots set in a three-dimensional plane.
    - A **contour plot** is a graph obtained by substituting a constant for $k$ in a level curve.
