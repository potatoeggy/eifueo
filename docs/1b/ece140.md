## Voltage, current, and resistance

Please see [SL Physics 1#Electric potential](/g11/sph3u7#electric-potential) for more information on voltage.

Please see [SL Physics 1#5.2 - Heating effect of electric currents](/g11/sph3u7/#52-heating-effect-of-electric-currents) for more information on current.

Please see [SL Physics 1#Resistance](/g11/sph3u7/#resistance) for more information on resistance.

**Electric charge** $Q$ quantises the charge of electrons and positive ions, and is expressed in coulombs (**C**).

Objects with charge generate electric fields, thus granting potential energy that is released upon proximity to another charge.

!!! warning
    Voltage and current are capitalised in **direct current only** ($V$, $I$). In general use, their lowercase forms should be used instead ($v, $i$).

**Voltage** is related to the change in energy ($dw$) over the change in charge ($dq$), or alternatively through Ohm's law:

$$i=\frac{dw}{dq}=\frac{i}{R}$$

**Current** represents the rate of flow of charge in amps (**A**). Conventional current moves opposite electron flow because old scientists couldn't figure it out properly.

$$i=\frac{dq}{dt}\approx \frac{\Delta q}{\Delta t}$$

### Power

Power represents the rate of doing work, in unit watts ($\pu W$, \pu{J/s})

$$P=\frac{dw}{dt}$$

It is also directly related to voltage and current:

$$P=vi$$

Much like relative velocity, power is directional and relative, with a positive sign indicating the direction of conventional current.

$$P_{CB}=-P_{BC}$$

In a closed system, conservation of energy applies:

$$\sum P_\text{in}=\sum P_\text{out}$$

The **ground** is the "absolute zero" voltage with a maximum potential difference. It is also known as the "reference voltage".

### Independent energy sources

!!! definition
    - A **ground** is the reference point that all **potential differences are relative to**.

A **generic voltage source** provides a known potential difference between its two terminals that is defined by the source. The resultant current can be calculated.

A **generic current source** provides a known amperage between its two terminals that is defined by the source. The resultant voltage can be calculated.

!!! tip
    A current in the **positive direction** indicates that the source is releasing power (is a source). Otherwise, it is consuming power (is a load).

### Dependent energy sources

A **dependent <&ZeroWidthSpace;T: voltage | current> source** has a **T** dependent on the voltage or current elsewhere in the circuit. $k$ is a function that is likely but not guaranteed to be linear.
